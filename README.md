## 🧠 Who Am I?

I'm not waiting to be told what to do. I build, optimize, and execute with intent. With the **mindset of a Product Manager**, the **precision of a Data Analyst**, and the **vision of a Business Consultant**, I turn scattered data into strategic clarity.

I operate at the intersection of tech, analytics, and business—where insights aren't just pretty graphs but actual levers that move KPIs.

Currently, I’m actively seeking **full-time opportunities** in the domains of **Product Management**, **Data Analytics**, and **Business Analysis** —  where I can leverage my analytical mindset, product thinking, and business acumen to drive strategic, data-informed decision-making.
